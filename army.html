                    <p><strong>W</strong>hat a relief we have each other.” Min Yoongi, otherwise known as Suga, reads his poem aloud to fellow BTS band members during an episode of RUN aired on V Live. He goes on to express how they were just seven boys with many dreams, and how thankful he was that they have achieved many milestones of success together.</p>
                    

                    <p>BTS (방탄소년단: Bangtan Sonyeondan) are a South Korean pop group consisting of seven bandmates: RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. The band has made a monumental impact with their music. Despite the well-deserved international recognition, the members of BTS have stayed to their roots and had emphasised on being 7 normal boys from South Korea. With their constant updates and/or communication with fans (via fancafes, Twitter, V Live episodes, fansigns), ARMY’s are able to know more of the members’ personalities and who they strive to be as people.</p>


                    <p>You may be wondering: who is the ARMY? “ARMY” is an acronym for “Adorable Representative M.C for Youth”, which is a term coined to refer to the BTS fandom. BTS when translated to the English, when translated to English,, language stands for “Bulletproof Boyscouts”. Any boy scout would need a bulletproof vest, and the ARMY acts as that shield for them.</p>

                    <p>The band has never been shy to speak about current social issues. Over the years, BTS has built a reputation as being one of the most socially conscious groups in Korea. Their lyrics have touched on subjects such as mental health, consumerism and the education system. I will be exploring on initiatives the members of BTS have been a part of, as well as how they have inspired their ARMY to do good work as well.</p>

                    <h3>UNICEF ‘Love Myself’ Campaign</h3>
                    <p>One of the most famous causes BTS has actively been a part of is their anti-violence campaign with UNICEF. Through the BTS Love Myself campaign, the band joins UNICEF Korea to #EndViolence against children and teenagers, with the hope of making the world a better place through their music. Their campaign has not only brought greater awareness of the need to protect young people suffering against violence, but it has also inspired the ARMY to get involved and donate to their cause as well. As of November 2018, the campaign has officially raised $1.4 million in total (1.6 billion KRW). The money donated to the cause came from direct donations of the ARMY, as well as a portion of sales from the band’s ‘Love Yourself’ album series. Donations towards the Love Myself campaign were also out of the members’ own earnings as well.</p>

                    <p>BTS were invited to the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly for the launch of UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited. Generation Unlimited is an initiative introduced to tackle global education and training crisis by greater progression in: secondary-age education; skills for learning, employability and decent work; and; empowerment. RM (the leader of BTS) delivered a powerful speech on self-love during their visit. His speech was not only well-articulated, but has encouraged many young people since.</p>

                    <h3>Donations/Charity Work: BTS Members’ Personal Donations</h3>

                    <p>The Korea Pediatric Cancer Foundation shared that Suga had donated 100 million won ($88,160) and toys for children struggling with cancer and leukemia. He had made this donation to commemorate his birthday in March of this year. The donation was also extra special as Suga made the donation in ARMY’s name, which expresses his gratitude to the fans who have shown the band so much love over the years. Suga is no stranger to donating in ARMY’s name, as he had Suga had donated 10 kg of Korean Hanwoo beef (top grade beef in Korea) along with signed copies of BTS’ albums to 39 orphanages back in 2018.
<br>
                        As of April 2019, it was reported that Jimin had donated 100 million won ($87,914 approximately) to the Busan Metropolitan City Office of Education to be used towards education development. The Office of Education divided and distributed Jimin’s donation to each school. The donation will be used towards student welfare including lunch money for students from low-income families and other necessary items. Jimin had also made personal donations to his childhood school (Hoedong Elementary School) to pay for the costs of school uniforms for graduating students.</p>

                        <p>In December 2018, the Korean Animal Welfare Association announced that Jin had made a birthday donation for animals in need. He had made a personal donation of 322 kg worth of pet food to the shelter.</p>

                        <p>According to Koreaboo, Jin has joined UNICEF’s “Honours Club” due to his generous donations every month. Despite keeping his donations low-key, UNICEF Korea’s secretary general Lee Ki Chul had thanked him for his meaningful contributions.</p>

                        <p>There is a sincerity in the boys’ efforts to do good, as they themselves do not publicise the personal donations that they have done. As of 2017, it was revealed that each member of BTS had personally donated 10 million won ($8500 approximately) to the Sewol Ferry Disaster 4/16 Family Council. The sinking of the Sewol Ferry had killed more than 300 passengers on April 16, 2014. The donation was made privately, but their company (Big Hit Entertainment) confirmed it after the news of their donation had broke out to the media.</p>

                        This is not an extensive list of initiatives, charities and donations BTS has contributed to over the years. You can read more about them through these websites: Korea Herald, Koreaboo, NME.

                        <h3>Donations/Charity Work: BTS’ Impact on ARMY</h3>
                        <p>Through the members’ positive efforts to make the world a better place, the ARMY were inspired to do good as well. In commemoration of the band’s 6th anniversary, the Singapore ARMY had organised a Food Bank project in their honor. A total of $2050 in donations were made, which allowed the fans to reach their goal of distributing at least 136 food bundles to those in need.</p>

                        ARMY has also donated a total of 30 million won ($26,373 approximately) to the Hope Bridge Korea Disaster Relief Association in BTS’ name to help the victims of the Gangwon Province wildfire. Another cause that the ARMY has make donations to is the Hapcheon Welfare Center for Atomic Bomb Victims located in South Gyeongsang Province. This was a shelter for Korean victims of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan. The Center shared that a BTS fanclub “Run Army” had donated 5.44 million won ($4860) approximately to the organisation. The ARMY were inspired to donate to alleviate the living situations of the victims. The money was consolidated from a fundraising that was conducted over 10 days.</p>

                         <p>In celebrating J-Hope’s birthday, some of the ARMY had gathered forces to make numerous donations in his honour. The Korea ARMY had donated 128 sacks of rice to J-Hope’s hometown (Gwangju City’s Buk District), and their efforts were acknowledged by the district. The ARMY had also delivered 700 kg of feed to animal shelters and animal rights groups on behalf of J-Hope. The ARMY had also partnered with the Korea Food for the Hungry International to organise “Hope of the Stop Hunger” project. This project aimed to sponsor starving children in 53 countries with emergency relief and food. BTS fangroup “Bulletproof Singapore” had organised the “A spoonful of Suga and Hope” initiative in collaboration with SASCO Senior Citizens’ Home. With the purchase of a drink and pastry, the amount goes towards covering the operations of the senior activity centre which includes the improvement of their facilities.</p>


                         <p>In celebrating V’s birthday, Korean ARMY “DC Inside V Gallery” donated a total of 4425 coal briquettes to homes around the country in his name. The fan group spoke up that due to coal prices increasing drastically, they were inspired to donate it to help those in need during the winter.
                         <br>
                            It was also reported that fans have donated nearly $10,000 worth of winter wear for surviving victims of Japanese military sexual slavery. Donations were gathered from fans hailing from South Korea, Japan, Europe and Latin America.</p>

                            <h3>ARMY’s Love For BTS: Fan Projects</h3>
                            <p>The band has inspired fans not only through their good deeds, but in their own personal lives as well. Fans not only from the UK, but worldwide, have expressed how much BTS and their music has helped them.</p>
                            <p>ARMY’s are often eager to conduct fan projects as this was one of the ways they could show love and support for the band. BTS has always talked fondly and highly of their ARMY, hence fan projects were a way for the ARMY to express their love in return.</p>

                            <p>Fan projects have taken all forms: banners, sing-alongs, co-ordinated lighting up’s of ARMY bombs.</p>

                           <p> One of the most recent and most heartwarming fan projects had happened during Day 2 of BTS at Wembley Stadium, UK. When the boys were backstage during a break, a notice for ARMY’s came up on the screen. ARMY’s were told to participate in a secret mission, which involved serenading their song “Young Forever” to surprise the members. The boys were caught off guard when ARMY’s started singing before their last performance. The boys were all emotional as ARMY’s sang along. “You can’t do this… This was not on the setlist”, RM joked. “We want to stay young forever, right? Let’s stay young forever, together!” he shouted.</p>
                        <center>
                           <iframe width="450" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKixYMiT_fA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </center>
                           <p>“Young Forever” was a particularly meaningful song. The lyrics touched on how they will keep singing regardless because they are doing what they love. It was released at a time when their fanbase had not grown as massive as it has today. There was not a dry eye in the audience. Not only were the audience members recalling their own experiences of how BTS has helped them through their music, but they were also touched by the sincerity of the boys in expressing their emotions.</p>

                           <p>These are some honourable mentions of fan projects that have been conducted over the years: the ‘Our flight will be forever’ project (Seoul), ‘Purple ocean’ project (Seoul), word formation fan project (Manila), ‘We believe in Bangtan’ project (Bangkok), the ‘2! 3! Fanchant’ project (Indonesia).

                        </p>

                        <p>What did BTS mean to the fans? How are we all able to connect despite not all of us understanding the Korean language? RM worded it beautifully during their performance at Wembley, saying, “We truly speak the same language. I don’t mean English, I don’t mean Korean — eye to eye, looking at each other, dancing, vibing… that’s how we do it.”</p>
<p>
BTS has made a positive influence not only through their own actions, but simultaneously inspiring their fans to do good as well.
</p><p>
During her appearance on the Zach Sang Show, their friend and music artist Halsey shared about ARMY’s showing their appreciation to her by donating to charities in her name. To sum up the impact BTS and ARMY have made together, I would like to quote this portion of her interview:</p>

<p class="unique">“Why isn’t everyone’s fans doing this? Can you imagine if everyone’s fans thanked them by organising charities in their name? What a better place this world would be.”

                    <p>I am writing about,</p>
                    <h3>How BTS Inspires Me? & How BTS is so inspiring to many people?</h3>
                    <p>I discovered BTS in 2017.

                    </p>
                    <div class="col-12">

                    </div>

                    <p>I get to know about them during my summer vacations, one of my best friends Natasha introduced them to me and it was at a time when I felt like I knew who I was and what my ideals, beliefs and attitude towards everything was. I felt like I knew what hard work, struggle, success, gratitude was. But watching BTS challenged me to question my values. I watched these seven boys till they became worldwide legends. Honestly , I will not say that my life changed and all stuff but I am thinking about how inspiring these guys really are, how can I learn a lot from them just if I am willing to apply those things in my life. So I think I can’t tell you how they motivated me, which qualities of them can motivate others just if someone is willing to learn. They practice 10 hours a day, work in that free time to produce and compose their music keeping in mind their level of influence and actually thinking about what sort of messages they want to send out. When there are any hiccups like an injury, a small mistake while performing they beat themselves up for disappointing their fans. BTS inspired me to find my dream, and to work hard towards it relentlessly whether or not success is rewarding me. They literally lived in a single room but smile over those difficult times and today they live in one of the most premier places in all of South Korea and travel the world first class. That’s more than enough motivation to never get deterred from trying your best. The kind of issues they chose to address as artists says a lot about the kind of people they are. And the most important thing they taught me to love myself and embracing my youth.</p>

                    <p>In September 2017, BTS launched their new album series titled Love Yourself. This series was dedicated to telling the story of the process of loving yourself. It all starts with the euphoric feeling of loving someone else, to the loneliness you feel when they leave, and ends with the realization that you are the only person that matters the most in your life. They taught me that no matter in what shape you are, what skin color you have, what height you have, just work hard to achieve your goals and love yourself.</p>

                    <p><strong>if you can’t love yourself then you can’t even love others.</strong></p>
                    

                    <div class="col-12">

                            <img src="images/army5.jpg" alt="error loading image" class="img-fluid imga ">

                    </div>

                    <p>For the majority of my life, I hated myself. I was so scared of what people thought of me, so I conceded into their idea of who they thought I was. They thought I was smart, so that’s who I became. I neglected to do things I wanted to do in order to uphold this image of what people painted me to be. I hated myself for doing things because of other people’s expectation of me. For my whole life, I lived to make other people happy, but that never made me happy. Back then I couldn’t bear criticism, I was really short tempered, and I spoke without thinking (which I still do). Knowing about their experiences, both positive and negative, they have really strengthened me. Whenever something bad or irritating happened ,I thought no worries, I still have YouTube, and in it BTS. They made me happy, that whatever bad may happen to you, you could still bring out the small positive aspects. They taught me that,</p>

                    <p><strong>Imperfection is uniqueness and uniqueness is perfection.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>No matter what others think, you are yourself and just the way you are-BTS.

                    </strong></p>
                    <p>These albums comforted me by showing me that it is okay to be the person who I want to be. Most importantly, it made me realize that I should I love myself enough to allow myself to be happy. The Love Yourself series reflected all the things I was struggling with. It was hard to find value in myself and to think of myself as someone worthy of happiness. There were so many moments in my life where I felt alone trying to battle this feeling of self-hatred. When BTS came out with this Love Yourself series, I finally felt like somebody understood me. BTS gave me a reason to love myself. Of course, I’m still learning to love myself, but lately, more often than not, I have this overwhelming feeling of love for who I am and the person I’m trying to be.</p>

                    <p><strong>Don’t forget your worth-BTS.</strong></p>
                    <p>I’d share what BTS’s each member has taught me,</p>
                    <p>RM- Kim-Namjoon, has taught me to be a strong loving person and a leader and to support my family & friends. He taught me to be confident and comical and also to be loyal.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Jin-Kim Seokjin, taught me to always be loving and kind and to take care of those who you love and who love you because it is so rewarding. He also taught me to love how I look unconditionally because that’s more important than other people loving how you look.

                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Suga-Min Yoongi, taught me to follow my dreams and pursue greatness no matter how long it takes or how many people don’t support you. He taught me to be confident in myself and to always keep going as there is always light at the end.

                    </p>

<p>J-Hope-Jung Hoseok, taught me to always be optimistic and fun loving and energetic even if you don’t particularly feel happy because it will always help others. He taught me to pursue my personal dreams and also that sacrifice and generosity are amazing things.</p>

                    <p>Jimin-Park Jimin, taught me to be proud of who I am and to always love myself unconditionally. I know he has had self esteem issues and body issues and some people have told him he needs to diet but through all this he has taught me I don’t need to meet everyone’s expectations of me, I only need to be what I want to be and I only need to satisfy myself. He has taught me to stay above the haters and still be gracious.

                    </div>

                    <p> V-Kim Taehyung, taught me don’t be afraid to be weird and over the top and excitable all the time as those who love you will accept you. He has taught me to be respectful to both young and old and he has taught me it’s okay to be a child at heart. He had taught me how important family is and that they shouldn’t be taken for granted. He has also taught me it’s okay to show your emotions to the people you love and care about. Taehyung has taught me that it doesn’t matter where you come from you can still be amazing if you work for it.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Jungkook-Jeon Jeongguk, has taught me to always be true to myself and not to listen to what others want to say against you. He has taught me to be happy and kind and respectful of those around me. He has taught me to stay grounded and also not to forget how education is important. The fact that he managed to be a K-pop star and graduate high school with really good grades is amazing.

                    <p>One thing of the many things that made me become a fan was because of how BTS songs seemed to draw me in and just heal my soul in general and make me want to be become a better person. Their songs inspired & heal me and taught to love myself fully, deeply, honestly, faithfully and gloriously.</p>

                    <p>And this is how BTS have affected me and helped me grow, I am still trying to accept and love myself fully, deeply, honestly, faithfully & gloriously and I am an Army (BTS name their fans, ARMY stands for Adorable Representative MC for Youth, but for BTS, the ARMY they help, protect and support them. ARMY literally means people who stand against and up for what is right for them).</p>

                    <p>RM, leader of BTS delivering a speech at the United Nations Assembly as the global ambassadors for the Generation Unlimited campaign.</p>

                    <p>Korean pop music is changing the world, and in more ways than you might think.

                    </p>
                    <p>When most people say “kpop”, they mean the sugar-sweet meaningless pop anthems that come from groups specifically manufactured to be financially successful. When I say “kpop”, I mean it as an umbrella term for all the popular music that comes from South Korea.

                    </p>
                    <p>In my family, I have been the herald of Kpop, bringing it into my family’s everyday life, and now it has been ingrained into our music culture. Hardly a morning goes by that I don’t hear BTS, or N’UEST or even Monsta X playing from downstairs as my siblings get their breakfasts.

                    </p>

                    <p>But I’m not here to talk about how much I love the music, I’m here to tell you how much a single band, 방탄소년단 (Bangtan Sonyeondan), or BTS, has taught me about community and finding inspiration.

                    </p>
                    <p>How could a band singing in another language teach me about community, you ask?</p>
                    <p>Simple: the community created around BTS is dedicated to reaching out to others, to helping each other through school, careers and everyday life.</p>
                    <p>There are fans that have become professional-level translators, working for free to make sure any fan can understand the lyrics of the songs from their favorite groups. There are fans that have dedicated their time and resources to providing academic aid to other fans, helping them navigate their school life — for free!
                    <br>
                    The kind of family that has formed around a mutual love of this colorful and creative group has made me fall in love with the world I live in. I interact with people from other countries on the daily, and I see so many people that have dedicated and honed amazing talents to this passion.</p>
                    <p>In a society obsessed with consumption, seeing people using their skills to create is a blessing, and whether it is 100% original or not, the growth of self in this community is the most inspiring thing I’ve ever witnessed</p>
                    <p>You might not expect Korean pop music to lead people to German philosophic writers and poetry, the Greek myths and even a book written by a neurosurgeon, but through a single South Korean band, I have discovered a literary and thought-provoking world that has shaped the way I see everything.
<br>
                        I was already a literature nerd, a characteristic hardly rare in a family of readers. I thrive on books that dig deep into cultural symbolism and seeing the everyday experience through a philosophic lens.</p>
<p>My favorite book is “Demian”, the novel from German author Herman Hesse, famous for “Siddartha” and “Steppenwolf”. Hesse writes from the perspective a young boy forced to question everything he’s been taught about the world.
<br>
    The symbolism and references to classical literature and art in their lyrics and music videos have introduced me to Hesse, George Orwell, Ursula Le Guin, even a Pre-Raphaelite painter.</p>
    <p>The storylines BTS creates and tells give birth to great complicated fan theories, requiring research and analyzing techniques they definitely do not teach you in high school. Sometimes I think that the best fan theorists could build successful careers in investigation —or teaching.</p>
    <p>Some of the fans are in high school, buy many more are in college or are children, parents, even grandparents. Age is not a barrier when it comes to BTS, and neither is social class, mental or physical abilities, language or location.
<br>
        A community is strongest when there is a mutual mantra or belief, and BTS' slogan, “Love Yourself”, is the most powerful one I’ve seen. It’s used as hashtag all over the world, and accompanies #LoveMyself for their “End Violence” partnership with the worldwide charity UNICEF. The campaign has raised, to date, over $1.4 million.</p>

        <p>Being part of a group of people, all over the world, dedicated to helping and showing love to others is the best thing I can say have ever done. Being able to say that I make a difference in the world is both a responsibility and an honor.</p>
        <p>There is so much more to BTS than just music, and much, much more to the fan base than “screaming teenage girls”, as the media loves to label them. A movement has been created, and I am simply happy to be along for the ride.</p>
