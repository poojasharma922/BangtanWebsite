        <h1 class="gap">BTS Gayo </h1>
        <p>BTS Gayo (“pop music”) is a BTS reality show consisting of 15 “tracks” (episodes) broken into two season.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="opening"><strong class="open1">Season 1 of BTS Gayo</strong> is 9 episodes and aired
                        starting in August 2015, about every 3-4 weeks.</p>
                    <p>Track 1 – Girl Group Dance Quiz – they have to replicate dances from various girl group songs and
                        then guess the title, like charades. Adorable. JK is quite good. RM is terrible.</p>
                    <p>Track 2 – Identify the song through listening – listen to a strange clip from an obscure Korean
                        pop song and then try to write down the lyrics you heard.</p>
                    <p>Track 3 – Recreate scenes from famous Korean kdramas – a must watch. JK has to cry using onions,
                        J-Hope and V almost kiss AGAIN, Suga and RM have to fake kiss and jump rope. A classic.</p>
                    <p>Track 4 – Bangtan Karaoke – they have to take turns singing one line of a song (a cutesy girl
                        group song from 1998), all the way down the line and back until they can sing the whole song as
                        a group. They can get hints if they do a challenge which leads to most of them trying to eat
                        gummy worms off of their face, and Jin again shows off that his toes are bizarrely agile. They
                        get hit on the head with a hammer when they mess up and the whole thing is adorable. Penalty in
                        the end: everyone gets a drink and 6 of them are tasty treats, and one is terrible.</p>
                    <p>Track 5 – Association Quiz – one team acts out a song and artist and the other team has to guess
                        – funny. Suga cheats J-Hope into taking the penalty.</p>
                    <p>Track 6 – BTS Best Dancer – dance off to see who is the worst dancer, then they have to guess
                        what fans voted on as their best dances. Suga challenges j-hope to a dance off and it is
                        awesome. I Need U was voted best dance (it was also their biggest hit to this time).</p>
                    <p>Track 7 – Male Singer Quiz – act out a song and artist and the other team guesses, like charades.
                        It’s the Red team versus the Black and White team. Jimin has to kiss V as a punishment.</p>
                    <p>Track 8 – Learn Trot Songs – trot is an old style of Korean pop involving funny repetitive
                        lyrics, like a novelty song; V (in a shiny yellow jacket) plays a song and the two other teams
                        of 3 have to guess. RM, Jin, and JK lose and have to “have their hair parted 2/8” (on the side).
                    </p>
                    <p>Track 9 – Best BTS Songs – guess the fan-voted best 5 BTS songs, with Suga as the MC. This was
                        quite confusing as we didn’t understand how the guessing worked. I Need U still considered the
                        top song overall.</p>
                    <p class="opening"><strong class="open1">Season 2 of BTS Gayo</strong> started airing in January
                        2017 and aired approximately monthly for 6 episodes.</p>
                    <p>Track 10 – Guess 2016 BTS song rankings, as voted by fans. Kind of interesting to see what were
                        the popular songs at this time&nbsp; – I Need U was the song that made them into BTS fans, 2!3!
                        Voted as the most popular song overall.</p>
                    <p>Track 11 – Pictionary with K-Pop bands (featuring Team Lack of Will and Team Unprecedented
                        Combination) – JK does all the guessing, but it’s older songs so he doesn’t get many right, and
                        we don’t know them either! Jin, V, and Suga have to go outside without coats as penalty.</p>
                    <p>Track 12 – Learn children’s songs from variety shows. Not a super great episode as it involves a
                        lot of songs we don’t know but does include the landmark moment that Suga says, “Uh huh. Listen
                        boy…my first love story.”</p>
                    <p>Track 13 – K-Pop song quiz. We didn’t know most of these songs but it was pretty cute. Each boy
                        gets his own “buzzer” that involves various challenges they have to do before answering, and
                        Suga and Jimin are cheaters, as always. In one round they have to name the song and then also do
                        the associated dance and it’s pretty funny. JK unexpectedly gets the penalty and has to do all
                        the “buzzer” jobs in one relay.</p>
                    <p>Track 14 – Movie soundtrack inspired games. From Rocky – jump rope in partners (involves a lot of
                        klutzy behaviour and hitting each other with the rope); from Scent of a Woman, identify your
                        partner’s body part by feeling the parts of several members (Suga as the MC “tangos” with each
                        contestant as well); from Love Actually, use a flip pad to draw words. For punishment, the
                        others write a “script” for a scene where they each write one line, and Jin and Jimin have to
                        perform a very silly scene about farts.</p>
                    <p>Track 15 – Produce their own MV (music video) for one of their songs that doesn’t have a video
                        yet. This is for Spine Breaker and is pretty funny.</p>
