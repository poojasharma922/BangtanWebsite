          <h2>Run BTS! Season 1</h2>
          <p>First aired weekly starting August 1, 2015 – 10 episodes. Opening credits song is not always used but when
            it is shown, it is Dope. Still available for free on vLive.</p>
          <p>1 – Intro to the the series; each member briefly introduces themselves.</p>
          <p>2 – Best man – featuring mouth-size measurement test and a tickle test – winner Jungkook!</p>
          <p>3 – Amusement park scary rides. Features the iconic smiley face icon over J-Hope’s face to protect his
            human rights.</p>
          <p> 4 – 30 seconds gate – challenges in a pool, including playing Jenga on a floating mat, and garlic juice
            drinking as punishment.</p>
          <p>5 – 100 second sports day – BTS must do a chain of activities inside of 100 seconds to “beat the staff,”
            and they finally do it, and make the director drink a gross drink.</p>
          <p>6 – Skit – they improvise a skit of people “confessing” to a priest. This episode was broken into two
            halves – 6 (1) and 6 (2); the first half features Jimin as the priest, and the second half features Suga as
            the priest.</p>
          <p>7 – start of a 4-episode arc; the boys play paintball. J-Hope is the distraction. Jungkook shakes Jimin
            around a lot.</p>
          <p>8 – continuation of above; the boys do a treasure hunt in the forest for flags that will earn them snacks.
            Four of them get 4×4 vehicles while three are on foot, but it turns out that being on foot is actually
            better. Jimin is sneaky a lot.</p>
          <p>9 – continuation of above; the boys do bungee jumping with various degrees of thrills and fear.</p>
          <p>10 – continuation of above; winners get to eat snacks while losers get some rice, and it’s revealed there
            was a spy all along who had secret tasks he was trying to accomplish without the others noticing.</p>
          <h2>Run BTS! Season 2</h2>
          
          <p> 11 – Skit in school, with 7 assigned roles – Suga is the female exchange student (known to fans as
            Yoonji). LEGENDARY.</p>
          <p>12 – Skit in jail, some are criminals and some are cops, Suga is the police sergeant and gets in some
            zingers. (“There has been a murder in the precinct. The skit died.”)</p>
          <p>13/14/15 – Water park challenges in teams – old ones versus young ones – and one person is the spy!
            Featuring a graphic demonstration that V doesn’t think like other people when he consistently fails to make
            the same shape as others during the shape game. Suga is the MC.</p>
          <p>16 – Snow Park – Winter Olympic Games – including a tube race down a snow hill, human curling, and a sled
            race around an ice rink.</p>
          <p>17/18 – Arcade Olympics – featuring the legendary basketball game turnaround, failure at Dance Dance
            Revolution by all the good dancers, and some impressive air hockey skills by V.</p>
          <p>19 – Bowling – everyone against JK, then team against team, where JK is fabulous and everyone else kind of
            sucks but owns it. Super cute all around.</p>
          <p> 20 – Taste of Korea (May 2017) – the first BTS cooking show, with Jin as MC and the others in two teams.
            Introduces the absolutely iconic squirrel dish, used by V. Jungkook makes sweet potatoes that stick to the
            dish.</p>
          <p>21 – BTS Board Games – Has a weird construction board game and features BTS playing UNO (the traditional
            version, before the invention of BTS UNO).</p>
          <p>22 – Hangawi Festival (October 2017) – featuring the boys in traditional Korean costumes making Chuseok
            dishes and playing traditional games for the holiday&nbsp; First sighting of the traditional game involving
            cardboard/paper squares – put one on the ground and smack it with another one to try to make the one on the
            ground flip over.</p>
          <p>23 – Dog training episode – the boys love dogs! They each bond with a dog trainee and try to get their dog
            to run a course.</p>
          <p> 24 – BTS vs. Zombies – BTS is told they are going on a zoo tour but it turns out to be a staged zombie
            attack. The best part is at the beginning when they are surprised and poor j-Hope, the biggest chicken among
            them, is pulled from the bus by zombies. Then they are supposed to solve escape-room style puzzles among the
            zombies but instead there is a lot of being scared and not a lot of successful solving of puzzles.</p>
          <p> 25 – Classic Korean video game head-to-head competition – surprisingly engrossing and thrilling
            considering they spend their whole time sitting in front of computers. Jimin gets a water punishment.</p>
          <p>26 – Secret Agent – the boys wear suits! They go through a secret agent challenge room (find things in the
            dark, go through a laser beam web) and then have a driving challenge with go-karts.</p>
          <p> 27/28 – Your First MT – kind of like a sleepover/frosh week event for BTS. They play a custom board game
            (BTS Marble) where they have to do little challenges when landing on certain squares. Suga and V are a team
            and there are many references to Hawaii, as they were paired up there during Bon Voyage 2. Then there is a
            karaoke competition where RM rocks out and Jin shows off some amazing shrieking skills.</p>
          <p> 29 – BTS Stylists – In answer to a promise they made to each other if they ever hit the Billboard top
            100, they each put together an outfit for one other member. Features Jimin looking amazing in Suga’s suit,
            Suga wearing all camo from JK, and J-Hope wearing 100 layers of pink from Jin.</p>
          <p> 30/31 – Classic Korean game show games. The first episode features a lot of games we don’t understand
            well, but has truly gorgeous outfits from the late 70s/ early 80s on the boys. Second episode is the winner
            – where they have to nap and then wake up after a half hour and sing the iconic Tomato Song.</p>
          <p> 32 – Christmas ornament hunt (December 2017) – where J-Hope is the giggling spy and has to run around
            cutting everyone else’s pig balloons off. SO FUNNY. Features V hiding in a glass case like a work of art and
            RM being devoted to the treasure hunt while everyone else just devolves into a chaotic game of run and hide;
            also features V protecting Jungkook, but then giving him up for unspecified “presents” five minutes later.
          </p>
          <p> 33/34 – Manito (like a Secret Santa kind of game) – This is the one with the ICONIC jumping photo poses,
            and the search and find challenge, and then an exchange of gifts, some of which are thoughtful, others of
            which are crappy. J-hope gets a giant box of cereal from Jin, among other strange items.</p>
          <p>35/36 – Kimchi Battle – Divided into teams, each team must make a unique kind of kimchi with the help of a
            chef; then in the second half, make dishes using the kimchi they made. Featuring RM and V unable to open
            gloves, RM almost cutting his finger off, and J-Hope making his radishes into hearts.</p>
          <p>37 – Return of BTS Marble – First they play Halli Galli – a card matching game like Snap – to determine
            order, and Jin proves he majored in Halli Galli at college. Then they play BTS Marble game – kind of like
            Monopoly with challenges to buy properties. Very cute.</p>
          <p> 38 – Spin BTS – A variety of challenges and games involving roulette wheels. Suga wears a giant Chimmy
            costume (Jimin’s character) due to a previous punishment. Includes the 3-way pulling game where they try to
            do a puzzle and JK is a beast (but can’t do puzzles). Also includes the step challenge where Jimin is
            amazing.</p>
          <p> 39 / 41 – Golden Bell Episodes – Two-parter but split in the middle with a different episode. Here they
            play classic games and this is the Lajimolala/Carbonara classic telephone game with Jin being a stone cold
            genius. The winner gets JK’s desktop computer and the boys are super pumped about that.</p>
          <p>40 – Lunar New Year Special – The boys wear traditional costumes and compete in games for good luck.</p>
          <p> 42 – Sports Challenge – The boys do a ropes obstacle course in a gym, and JK is amazing, J-Hope is
            scared, and Jin says “OH!” a lot. Then they do a flying jump – grab a hanging bag challenge. J-Hope gets the
            water hat punishment.</p>
          <p> 43/44 – 5 Senses Episodes (March 2018) – Includes hand sniffing, RM being pouty when he has trouble
            seeing, and a cool challenge where they have to pick out one member from the group just by listening for the
            right voice. Suga wears a giant RJ costume (due to a previous punishment). Also features J-Hope reaching
            into a mystery box to feel things and being totally squeamish. At the end, RM and V finally do their
            mountain hiking challenge/punishment from a few episodes back while Jin gets up early to make them lunch
            from scratch.</p>
          <p>45 – BTS Cafe – The members learn to make espresso and other fancy drinks. Jin wears a Cooky costume for
            past punishment reasons. V really does not like coffee.</p>
          <p>46 – BTS Pottery Workshop – V spills his finished products on the floor and a lot of clay goes to waste on
            other messed up projects as the members try to figure out how a pottery wheel works.</p>
          <p> 47/48 – Protect the Town – The town (a little indoor set meant for children to explore and play) has
            been infiltrated with someone from the Blue Village. The boys must search for clues to try to find the
            outsider. The second episode reveals a surprising twist – there’s more than one outsider!</p>
          <p> 49/50/51 – Celebration of their 50th episode with an awards ceremony, memories video, and visit to Lotte
            world (an amusement park) where they have to try to complete challenges and answer trivia while on rides.
            Features Suga and J-Hope in bear hats and being totally terrified (poor RM, who is on their team); V and JK
            enjoying the rides but being unable to memorize anything; and RM learning to blow a bubble from gum on the
            water ride.</p>
          <p>52 – BTS Escape – The boys break into teams to do escape rooms.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> 53/54/55/56 – BTS Picnic (July 2018), an iconic 4-part series. Featuring terribly hilarious foot
            volleyball and their classic poems for each other read over the final campfire.
          </p>
          <h2>Run BTS! Season 3</h2>
          
          <p>57/58 – BTS Chef – Divided into 3 teams, they must cook Italian food using one kind of meat and one kind of
            pasta. During a cream whipping challenge, Jimin pours his liquidy result on his head.</p>
          <p>59/60 – BTS in Hotel – BTS play games while sitting on their hotel room floor. Involves guessing their own
            songs with noise overtop, translating their own English lyrics to Korean (fascinating), and guessing numbers
            of stuff in food packets. Winners Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook win a pass to give their future penalty to
            someone else.</p>
          <p>61/62 – Sauna – The boys go to a sauna. Games include some weird acronym solving game we found it hard to
            understand, and then a throw-water-in-the-face-of-your-opponent with bowls for protection game.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> 63/64/65 – School-based games with Suga as the teacher. This series includes them playing a song using
            ringing bells (Jimin takes over for his whole team) and the classic debate on mint chocolate ice cream: good
            or evil? During the debate, they get sprayed with water when they say their “off limits” word, and J-Hope’s
            is that he gets sprayed whenever he laughs, and he cannot figure it out and gets sprayed a LOT.</p>
          <p>66/67 – Comic Book Cafe – Various challenges inside a comic book cafe; each boy picks his favourite manga.
            Jungkook says “bono bono yah” and is generally mischievous.</p>
          <p>68 – Heart Pang – playing a board game called Heart Pang in their hotel room. Not a great episode! The game
            was very confusing and we never really understood what was going on – and neither did BTS!</p>
          <p> 69/70/71 – BTS goes to Toronto, and visits Niagara Falls. The choosing of the bedrooms is absolutely
            iconic. There is a lot of shopping. In the evening they play a bunch of games to transfer their penalty
            points to each other and it’s pretty hilarious – includes staring games, word games, bottlecap flicking, and
            many head-to-head challenges.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> 72 – Mafia – BTS play Mafia. There are so many twists! Someone is a secret spy…but the tables are turned
            when it turns out EVERYONE was a secret spy with their own agenda. Very fun!</p>
          <p>73/74/75/76 – Dalbang Dorm – The boys film several scenes/episodes in their own Korean drama – the story of
            7 boys learning to live together in a dorm. JK works very hard as the slate king and it’s a long day for
            everyone, but the finished result is pretty polished and cute. The best parts are a) them giggling when
            trying to film the very first scene, blowing many takes, and b) JK pretending to be the director during the
            audition part and taking advantage of his new position to use informal language with Jimin and Jin (always
            funny!).</p>
          <p>77/78 – Food Guessing Games – Things like food pictionary with mouth markers, guess the food when listening
            to the recipe at double speed, a food memory game, and food bingo. Jin is the host. In the end, the
            punishment team – Jimin, J-Hope, and V – have to wear bunny hats to the airport with varying degrees of
            enthusiasm.</p>
          <p> 79/80 – Mall Scavenger Hunt – They must search for tickets and items over two floors of a mall, and play
            various games to exchange their tickets for hearts. Everyone is super sneaky and lies about how many hearts
            they have gathered, so the end result is a (legendary!!) surprise to all.</p>
          <p>81/82 – VR Games – Various VR games – the best part is when j-hope is so scared to go up in a tall building
            and the other members (on his own team!) push him off. This episode includes the final twist/betrayal where
            SUGA and j-Hope are supposed to take the penalty, but each have a “get out of a penalty” card. J-Hope wanted
            to do the penalty (a horror escape room) with Suga, but Suga went off book and decided to use his pass on V
            (who passed it on to Jin). So in revenge, J-Hope uses his pass on Suga!</p>
          <p> 83/84/85 – Summer Outing/Water park (August 2019) – the boys have to answer math questions while going
            down a water slide; play terrible water polo; get bounced hilariously in the air by a bouncing slide; and
            it’s everyone versus JK in a water obstacle course. Features the meme where JK, V, and Jimin run to jump in
            the pool but then JK and V don’t jump! It ends with them exchanging gifts and some are good, some bad, but
            the best one is when J-Hope gives Jimin a custom-made CD of his single, Promise.</p>
          <p> 86//87/88 – Hangul Day (October 2019) – they play a variety of word games and other games to celebrate
            Hangul day. This is the series where they play hide and seek / tag, and have to put stickers on the back of
            their particular target, and V and Jimin almost break up forever after V lies and swears Jimin is not his
            target. In the first episode, they play word/trivia games that are pretty tough to earn the stickers for the
            hide and seek game. The other two are the chase game and there is much hilarious back stabbing, hiding,
            squealing, and lying.</p>
          <p>89/90 – BTS Gayo is back – a variety of music-based games. First they play the brand new edition of BTS UNO
            to determine who will choose teams (Suga wins). Then they play draw the song, guess the backwards lyrics,
            dance the choreo from one song to a different song. Jungkook is really good. Jimin falls out of his chair
            and Jungkook falls on top of him. Jin wears a hideous Joker hoodie zipped up over his face. Suga is screwed
            into taking the punishment.</p>
          <p>91/92 – Mini Golden Bell – school style games on the floor of their hotel room in London. Games include:
            listen to a sound clip from a past episode and identify who said it and where; listen to some of their
            lyrics in Korean but spoken with a foreign accent and try to identify the song and phrase; betting thing
            where they are given a statement (“V has the second longest arms”) where they have to predict if that is
            true or false, then they measure/sing/whatever to find out. V is the MC and absolutely hates it and is
            terrible, but wins a prize: the next time he is punished he can choose one other person to go with him. One
            claim is that Jin’s shoulders are wider than 50cm and when they measure, they find his shoulders are only
            48cm (but later fan-based estimations based on chairs he has sat in put his shoulders at 60cm, so who
            knows). Arm length in BTS goes RM, JK, V, Suga, j-hope, Jin, Jimin. J-hope loses.</p>
          <p>93/94 – BTS Marble (again) – nothing super special but general mayhem and chaos. There are a few pedometer
            games and lots of playing of 007. The game ends up going very long and the real win is when they manage to
            finish it. Three of them wear sunflowers around their faces when they arrive home in Korea at the airport as
            punishment.</p>
          <p>95/96 – Classic Korean games – make honeycomb candy, play jacks, play an interesting bottlecap
            sliding/territory taking/chalk game; then they play Beyblades (including the legendary Rock Bison) and race
            little motor cars. It becomes clear that Jimin had a very good childhood and has fond, loving memories of
            all these games, while Suga has never seen any of them. Nothing special but still very charming and chaotic.
            Jin is the host.</p>
          <p> 97/98 – PJ party – so cute. Features ASMR challenge, karaoke, telestrations. Everything you need to feel
            better about the world – a must watch.</p>
          <p> 99 – Florist – boys make flower arrangements with the help of a professional. Hilarious! The members
            spend an uncomfortable amount of time noticing how attractive the (male) florist is and then they make
            creations of various quality. Suga makes a boutineer entitled “whatever was nearby.” V’s boutineer breaks
            and he is sad. Jin makes a crown that is so terrible, it is never not funny.</p>
          <p class="opening"><strong>A new opening was revealed for Run BTS episode 100 using the song ON.</strong></p>
          <p> 100/101 – repeat challenges from past shows. Includes badminton played with objects like a frying pan,
            ping pong paddle, and pot lid; return of the jump photo but this time using a trampoline; return of the
            secret box reveals. At the end the boys get gifts of a gold medallion and a giant poster of themselves.
            Episode 101 also has a “director’s cut” on vlive.</p>
          <p> 102/103 – Avatar Cooking – this is where Jin and Suga are giving the directions from another room, and
            the others have to try to cook using what they say. Suga loses it when it turns out Jimin and RM put in
            double salt instead of salt and sugar. J-Hope is the host.</p>
          <p> 104/105/106 – Photo Challenge. A must watch. First, the members select a few items of clothing to
            “makeover” with accessories, clothing paint, sewing supplies and a glue gun. Jin makes a legendary pair of
            pants from Hawaiian swim trunks + the arms of a gold sequined jacket. Then they have to draw to see who will
            wear which outfit, and poor JK, who took the most care with the outfit he created, has to wear Jin’s
            horrifying creation. Then they have a themed photo shoot as individuals and small groups, which is awesome,
            then they have a gallery reveal of the best pics. Suga ends up “winning” with his photo of JK and wins a
            legendary photo of Jimin looking like New Actor Trainee Jimin (later revealed to be hanging in the BTS
            offices!).</p>
          <p>107/108 – Online games – the members visit a video game cafe to play some online games. There are some
            funny moments when they play the final game, which is a fighting game like Smash Bros.</p>
          <p> 109 – Dubbing – the boys dub over scenes from Disney movies, ICONIC. This episode also has a “director’s
            cut” on vlive. They do such a good job! Jimin, Jin, and j-hope in particular are great, but the best moment
            is Suga as Woody saying, “Annyeong!”</p>
          <p>110/111 – Treasure Hunt in the Hyundai Motors studio (August 2020). This one was very cute – the members
            first solve clues for hints, then search the car museum for clues to a treasure. The best part is the
            treasure itself – that the boys get to just leave and go home! JK decided to just take the punishment
            instead of trying – so he is left alone hours after the others have gone. Funny!</p>
          <p> 112/113 – Dalbang School challenges (October 2020) – with Jin as MC, the boys divide into teams to do
            school-based challenges. Features the classic clip of V doing the limbo with Suga on his back. Other games
            include playing a song on the recorder, finding the differences between two pictures, and eating lunch
            without getting caught by teacher Jin.</p>
          <p>114/115 – League of Number One – the members play games and video games with T1, an eSports team from Korea
            that has won the League of Legends world championship three times. Super cute because a) extroverts j-hope
            and V are so adorably excited to make new friends and b) BTS makes fun of the pro players for messing up
            silly little video games.</p>
          <p> 116/117 – Teamwork Special – Given 16 possible missions, BTS must work together to complete 5 of them
            before they can go home. Adorable – it’s like hanging out with them for an afternoon in a games room. Also
            Suga is incredibly charming about six times over.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> 118/119 – Photo Story. The boys must collect post it notes to make sentences that describe a picture,
            then try to snap that picture for points. In the second episode it is revealed that one of them was a spy,
            and any pics including that member will turn into negative points, and Jungkook is SO FUNNY when he sees his
            dreams of gold turn to dust.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>120/ 121 – BTS Village 2 – Boys play a sort-of murder mystery game – they are given roles and must figure
            out which one of them is the bad guy who broke the ARMY headstone. It’s a little confusing and of course
            accusations fly. Notable because Jin shows once again he is a super genius when it comes to games.</p>
          <p> 122/123 – Avatar Cooking Reversed (December 2020) – With RM as the host, JK/Jimin and V/J-Hope must give
            instructions to Jin and Suga, walking them through the cooking of a few dishes. Everything is chaotic and
            hilarious.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>124 (January 2021) – Writer, Director – an episode where they brainstorm ideas for future Run BTS episodes.
          </p>
          <p>125 – K-HAM special – first episode without Suga as he was out with surgery. The members cook in their own
            kitchen at the dorm with Korean celebrity chef Baek Jong-won (also known as Paik Jong-won in alternate
            romanization) — V and RM are fanboys and want his autograph for their moms. There is a lot of spam (it is a
            product placement). V is pretty weird, but the food turns out well.</p>
          <p> 126/127 – 777 Lucky Seven – Suga is in these episodes and seems fine so this is another pre-surgery set.
            The members play a variety of minute-to-win-it style games – there are 14 games and they must pass them all
            to be able to go home. JK is a god and Suga and j-hope are terrible (but manage to turn things around) and
            there is general adorable mayhem, plus an appearance by Jimin’s New Trainee/Sears Catalogue Boys’ Page
            portrait from episode 106.</p>
          <p> 128 – Korean New Year 2021 and Games at Home – without Suga. The other members play games you can do at
            home – red light green light, play a harmonica and guess the song, try not to smash an egg, and a bluffing
            game where one member doesn’t know the secret password but must convince the others he does. V kisses Jin on
            the cheek and RM and V smash a lot of eggs.</p>
          <p>129/130 – Tennis Lesson – they begin their “long term project” of learning to play tennis with an outdoor
            group lesson from some famous Korean players, then some indoor lessons at a gym. Suga is there for the first
            lesson as this is just before his surgery, but out for the other lessons. J-hope is the pride and joy of
            BTS.</p>
          <p> 131/132 – Poolside debates – 7 debates on silly topics, each for 11 minutes. If the members say certain
            words, they get sprayed with a water cannon in the face. If they do certain actions, they all get sprayed
            and the central moderator gets a giant water bomb. So funny it’s hard to breathe, absolutely legendary.</p>
          <p>133/134/135 – BTS Trivia challenge – members (without Suga) have to search online for the answers to BTS
            trivia questions, then have to “guess the dance” when shown a very bad dancer doing their choreography;
            then, in the third episode they have to hide a “k-pop related” item somewhere in the building and go on a
            search. JK loses the first round and has to use a giant, hilariously oversized keyboard. Jin is brilliant at
            hiding stuff, as expected.</p>
          <p>136/137 – Silly Answers contest – given phrases in Satoori (localized slang) they have to guess what they
            mean; identify numeric codes people used to use on pagers to communicate phrases; song lyric charades;
            translated lyrics interpretation; 1-second song sample guess; and guess the mash-up of songs. Jimin/JK,
            RM/V, and Jin/j-hope are the teams (Suga is still out from his surgery). Almost everyone attempts to call
            their moms for help with varied results (JK is the most successful, and his mom loves Jimin!) and everyone
            is a shameless answer stealer (poor V!).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>138/139 – Learn to play ping pong! Still no Suga. Cute, they all do surprisingly well. V is the champ.</p>
          <p> Episode 140 / 141 – This is actually a 4-episode arc in conjunction with a Korean game show, 15ya / Game
            Caterers. The members (including SUGA, who returns after his surgery) go on a small “retreat” to a house in
            the forest. In the first episode (Run BTS episode 140), they play a celebrity ID name with the Game Changers
            host, Na Young Seok, for BBQ items, but end up with only kimchi and rice; Jin, Jimin, and V make a deal for
            a few strips of pork belly, and SUGA cooks. In the second episode – on the – they are each given a secret challenge and
            it devolves into complete chaos as they sabotage each other for the prize of $700 in gift certificates – SO
            FUNNY. In the third episode (Run BTS episode 141), they play a Jeopardy-style song naming game, but first,
            each member must list their biggest flaw, and then yell out that flaw to “ring in.” The flaws are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>JK – I want to do many things, but I lack patience (can’t commit to projects)</li>
            <li>SUGA – I am physically weak and lose concentration easily</li>
            <li>Jimin – I can be blunt</li>
            <li>RM – I’m not well-rounded (meaning, does not have a lot of real world practical skills)</li>
            <li>Jin – I don’t think about things</li>
            <li>V – I’m irresponsible and lazy</li>
            <li>J-hope – When I’m alone, I get quiet and it makes my parents worry.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="opening"><strong>A new opening was revealed for Run BTS episode 142 using the song Butter.</strong></p>
          <p>142 (June 2021) – Cooking show with Celebrity chef Baek Jong-won. Chef Paik is back and is a delightful
            father figure to the members in the kitchen (except for Suga, as this was filmed while he was still out from
            shoulder surgery). The members break into two teams (Jin, JK, V and Jimin, RM, j-hope) to make kimchi dishes
            from scratch and everyone is very pleased with the delicious results.</p>
          <p>143 – Telling fairy tales. The members (without SUGA) are divided into two teams of three – j-hope, Jin,
            and Jungkook versus RM, Jimin, and V. Each group is to compose a children’s book or fairy tale, then
            illustrate it. V ends up wanting to write his own book and breaks away from his group, only to find that
            it’s too much work for one person, so he steals j-hope from the other team, resulting in three teams of two.
            Once the stories are written, they call SUGA and ask him to read the stories out loud and comment on them;
            he agrees, so the end of the episode shows him in the Genius Lab reading the books out loud.</p>
          <p>144 – BTS ARMY Quiz. Based on ARMY answers to an online survey in early 2021, the members (OT7) try to
            guess at songs ARMY loves the most and would most like to see performed live.</p>
          <p>145 / 146 / 147 – Korean Folk Village (Yongin City). A continuation of the BTS Village storyline started in
            episodes 47/48 and carried on in episodes 120/121. The ARMY bomb that was broken by RM/V in the last segment
            caused them to travel through time back to historical Korea. Dressed in traditional costumes, they must try
            to find the missing piece of the ARMY bomb, as well as complete an individual mission for hints/powers, and
            try to identify which ones of them are spies – all while avoiding the guards who are trying to arrest them
            as thieves. As usual, the rules are hazy, no one really seems to know what’s going on, poor JK’s cameraman
            runs a marathon, and there is total chaos, especially at the end when the members try to figure out who is
            good (and can therefore join in on the ARMY bomb raising to the sky), and who is a traitor (and therefore
            must be banned from touching the ARMY bomb).</p>
          <p>148 / 149 – Interior Decorating. The members are broken into two teams – SUGA leads Jimin and JK, Jin leads
            RM, j-hope, and V. An opening decor-related trivia contest turns into a SUGA/RM showdown for advantages, and
            ends in a dead heat. Then, the teams go on to decorate a room each, by building a lot of IKEA furniture,
            painting, and laying floor tile.</p>
          <p>150 / 151 – Hotel Staycation. The members are taken to the brand new Josun Palace Hotel in Korea for the
            day for a staycation. First they play musical and trivia games to decide who gets which room – Jungkook
            shows off his perfect pitch and uses it to win the master suite. Then, they each get a day to spend alone in
            their room doing whatever they like – napping, playing video games, reading, watching TV are all on the
            menu. There’s an additional challenge where they are allowed to order food and games from a special menu,
            and if they hit the “mystery budget” exactly, they will win a cash prize. RM figures out that the mystery
            budget is “801 000 won” based on the very first Run BTS airdate of August 1, 2015, and they do manage to win
            the prize of 1000000 won each.</p>
          <p> 152 / 153 – Aluminum Tray Singing Game. Based on a Korean game show, BTS has to sing a song line by line
            – and when they make a mistake, they get bonked on the head by an aluminum tray falling from the ceiling. To
            win helps/advantages, they first play a cartoon show theme song guessing game, which Suga rocks despite not
            seeing most of the shows, and makes Jimin very frustrated. In Part 2, they sing older Korean songs as
            karaoke for additional points (or negative points, depending on how well they do). Suga loses (based on his
            terrible karaoke) and has to take the punishment – walking a narrow bridge between the two towers of Seoul’s
            tallest building, with RM has his chosen sidekick. Even if you don’t know Korean or the older songs here,
            OT7 are so charming and funny, your face will hurt from smiling.</p>
          <p> 154 / 155 – The Last. After announcing that regular episodes of Run BTS would go on hiatus, they aired
            this last episode where the members remember great moments from the show. They then repeat a couple of their
            most popular past challenges, including the photo jumping challenge (just as funny as the first time!), have
            a picnic, and receive a photo book of memories from the staff.</p>
          <h2>Run BTS! Season 4 (Special Episodes)</h2>
          <p>As promised, BTS started airing occasional episodes of Run BTS on an irregular basis starting in 2022.
            Opening credits song for these is Run BTS (of course!). Episodes are available for free on Weverse, vLive,
            and YouTube.</p>
            <p><span>RUN BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Telepathy Part1/ Part 2</span>As per the latest episode, the theme of the game 'one body, one soul', is proving to be not an easy task. The new episode tests members on how well they know each other.</p>
