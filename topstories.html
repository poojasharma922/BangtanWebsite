                          <p class="card-text">ARMY proposals to BTS’ Suga have become an inside joke between the fanbase and the septet. It’s a never-ending saga, that whenever any of the members are doing a Live, invariably, a fan proposal comes for Suga with the words, “Yoongi (his real name), marry me.”
                            There’s almost a set pattern to the comedy now, as it’s usually V (born Kim Taehyung) who reads it out, with the other bursting into laughter.....</p>

                          <p class="card-text">BTS V’s smooth whisper to Olivia Rodrigo, ahead of the band’s performance at Grammys dominated ARMY discourse on Twitter for a while. Before he went on stage, V, born Kim Taehyung, walked over to Olivia in true James Bond style, handed over a card and whispered to her.
                        Recently, on Weverse, V revealed what he whispered to her. A fan asked, “Taehyung, what did you whisper to Rodrigo? It was an awesome scene…” V responded, “Just important business. We know each other well right. I didn’t even use English.” In another post, V was asked if he actually said something to Olivia. He answered, “I did say something but I was so nervous because of the stage, so I forgot what did I say. Maybe it’s ‘You have to be surprised now.’....</p>
